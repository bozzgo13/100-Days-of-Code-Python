# 🃏 Python Blackjack (21)

A terminal-based implementation of the classic casino game **Blackjack**. This project was developed independently as a "code from scratch" challenge, focusing on game flow logic, list manipulation, and conditional win/loss states.

---

## 📝 Description

This version of Blackjack follows standard gameplay rules where the player attempts to get a card sum as close to 21 as possible without going over ("busting"). 

### Key Project Highlights:
* **Independent Development**: All game logic was developed from scratch without consulting external solution keys or instructor snippets.
* **Pure Python**: Built using standard Python libraries (`random`) and custom functions for modularity.
* **Dealer AI**: Includes a built-in dealer logic that follows the "stand on 17" rule (hits on 16 or lower).
* **Reference**: Rules and gameplay flow are based on the [Washington Post Blackjack](https://games.washingtonpost.com/games/blackjack) standard.
