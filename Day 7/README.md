# 🎮 Hangman Game (Slovenian Edition)

A classic, terminal-based **Hangman** game written in Python. The game selects a random word from a predefined list, and the player must guess it letter by letter before the gallows are completed.

## 📝 Description

This project is a simple implementation of the Hangman game using basic Python concepts such as:

* **Lists and Strings:** To store words and track progress.
* **Loops (`while`, `for`):** To handle the game state and word masking.
* **Conditional Logic (`if`, `elif`, `else`):** To determine if a guess is correct and when the game ends.
* **ASCII Art:** To visualize the hangman stages in the terminal.
