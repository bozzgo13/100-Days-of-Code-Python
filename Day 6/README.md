# Reeborg's World: Hurdle 3 Solution

This repository contains my Python solution for the **Hurdle 3** challenge in the [Reeborg's World](https://reeborg.ca/reeborg.html?lang=en&mode=python&menu=worlds%2Fmenus%2Freeborg_intro_en.json&name=Hurdle%203&url=worlds%2Ftutorial_en%2Fhurdle3.json) interactive game.

## About the Project
Reeborg's World is a platform where you use programming (Python) and pre-defined functions to control a robot through various obstacles. 

In the **Hurdle 3** challenge, the hurdles are placed at random intervals. The goal is to write a flexible algorithm that allows Reeborg to detect an obstacle, jump over it, and continue moving until the final goal is reached.

### Solution Showcases
Below are three different random obstacle layouts where the algorithm successfully guided Reeborg to the finish line:

| Scenario 1 | Scenario 2 | Scenario 3 |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |

## The Code
The logic that handles all these scenarios can be found in the main file:
👉 **[Hurdle3.py](./Hurdle3.py)**
