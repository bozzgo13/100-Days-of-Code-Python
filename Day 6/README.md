# Reeborg's World: Hurdle Challenges

This directory contains my Python solutions for the **Hurdle 3** and **Hurdle 4** challenges in [Reeborg's World](https://reeborg.ca/reeborg.html).

## Project Overview
Reeborg's World is a puzzle game where you control a robot using Python. A very fun way to test the basic building blocks of a programming language and see the results in the form of a game

## 🏃 Hurdle 3
In this challenge, hurdles are placed at random intervals. The robot must move forward and jump only when it detects a wall in front of it.

## 🏔️ Hurdle 4
Hurdle 4 is significantly more difficult because the **height of the hurdles is random**. The robot must "climb" until it finds the top of the wall, move across, and descend back to the floor.
