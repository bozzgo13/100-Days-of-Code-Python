## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Language:** Python 3

## 📦 Libraries
Below is a list of key Python libraries used in this course, along with their purposes and links to official documentation:

### 🎨 GUI & Graphics
* **[Turtle](https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html)** – A built-in graphics library for learning the basics of programming and OOP.

### 📊 Data Science & Analysis
* **[Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/)** – A high-performance library for data manipulation and analysis (DataFrames).

### 🛠️ Utilities & Data Files
* **[math](https://docs.python.org/3/library/math.html)** – Provides access to mathematical functions such as `ceil()`, `floor()`, and constants like `pi`.
* **[random](https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html)** – A built-in module used to generate pseudo-random numbers, select random elements, and shuffle sequences. (Crucial for games like Rock Paper Scissors and Hangman).
* **[csv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html)** – A built-in library for reading and writing tabular data in CSV format. (Used before moving to Pandas).
