# The program will ask:
# ```
# How many letters would you like in your password?
# How many symbols would you like?
# How many numbers would you like?
# ```
# The objective is to take the inputs from the user to these questions and then generate a random password.
# Use your knowledge about Python lists and loops to complete the challenge.
